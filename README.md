Microsoft is aiming to create new movie studio. They require recommendations on the type of movies doing well at Box office. Recommendations include actionable insights to help Microsoft with new movie studio. 

upon sifting through the datasets, I noticed that, out of ten different tables in CSV and JSON format, I can use five tables to extract desired data. 

bom.movie_gross.csv.

imdb.title.crew.csv.

imdb.title.principals.csv.

imdb.title.basics.csv.

imdb.name.basics.csv.gz.


applying merge joint and some methods, I could come to my three recommedations. 


  Recommendation 1 - Movie Genres  

![]()

  Recommendation 2 - Best Directors to work with  

![]()

  Recommendation 3 - Best Writers to work with
