Microsoft is aiming to create new movie studio. They require recommendations on the type of movies doing well at Box office. Recommendations include actionable insights to help Microsoft with new movie studio. 

upon sifting through the datasets, I noticed that, out of ten different tables in CSV and JSON format, I can use five tables to extract desired data. 
\bom.movie_gross.csv.\
\imdb.title.crew.csv.\
\imdb.title.principals.csv.\
\imdb.title.basics.csv.\
\imdb.name.basics.csv.gz.\

I used >“bom.movie_gross”> dataset to extract highest domestic gross from 2014 to 2018. Thus narrowing down the list to top 20.
